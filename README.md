# P2P CryptoCurrency Network Simulator

Discrete Event Simulator to simulate the proof of work cryptocurrency and study the impact of hashing power of a node, mean block interarrival time, mean transaction interarrival time, whether node is slow or fast, whether it have high cpu or not on the number of block generated by it in longest chain or canonical chain at end of simulation.

## Features

- Discrete Event Simulation 
- Loop less forwarding
- Network delays simulation
- Proof of Work for consensus
- Orphan Block Handling
- Analysis of Blockchain statistics
- Randomized node properties (fast/slow, low cpu/ high cpu, hashing power)
- Transaction and Block validation
- Randomized Network Topology
- Block and Transaction structure close to real world

## Tech Stack

**Python**: The core language used to create the project.

**Matplotlib**: Used for visualization of blockchain tree after end of simulation.  

**Networkx**: The python library used to model the network between the nodes.

## Run Locally

Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/menishantsharma/P2P-Cryptocurrency-Network-Simulator
```

Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd P2P-Cryptocurrency-Network-Simulator
```

Create python virtual enviroment

```bash
python3 -m venv myvenv
```

Activate the python virtual environment created

```bash
source myvenv/bin/activate
```

Install dependencies

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```


(Optional) Install PyGraphviz
```bash
pip install pygraphviz
```

Run the simulation

```bash
  python3 main.py --z0 50 --z1 50 --n 10 --T 1000 --ttx 1 --tblk 100
```
-  `--z0`: Percentage of slow nodes
- `--z1`: Percentage of low cpu nodes.
- `--n`: Total number of nodes.
- `--T`: Total simulation time (in seconds).
- `--ttx`: Mean transaction interarrival time (in seconds).
- `--tblt`: Mean block interarrival time (in seconds).
